# Lab 3 - AWS DMS - Endpoint Configuration for your source - MySQL

## Objectives

In this exercise, you will
* Create an AWS DMS Replication instance
* Create an AWS DMS endpoint that points to MySQL database server
* Test endpoint Connection

## Premise
In order to migrate your database from your transactional system to Redis, you would need AWS DMS( Data Migration Service). In this exercise, you are going to create an AWS DMS ( Data Migration Service) Replication instance and establish a connection from DMS service to your source system MySQL database. To do this, you need to define an endpoint for your source system and test the connectivity between your DMS instance and the MySql database server endpoint.


## Creating AWS DMS Replication instance
1. Its time to login into your AWS Web Console.
Make sure you choose the right region of your choice. In this case, I chose us-west-2 (Oregon)

Go ahead and search for DMS service and select it.

2. In the AWS DMS Dashboard, select Replication Instance and go ahead and create a Replication instance.

Choose a Name, Description, Instance Class and storage, as shown.

3. VPC Configurations:
* You are going to launch this Replication instance in the same VPC as your source database system : MySQL is running.  So, choose the VPC you created in the previous exercises.
* Choose MultiAZ to a single AZ option as this is only for a learning exercise.
* You can uncheck the ”Publicly accessible” flag to NO, so that this Replication instance is only accessible via private network.
* Choose the Replication subnet to a default one suggested.
* Select AZ as us-west-2a
* Leave “default” for VPC Security Group

4. Launching Replication instances:
* Go ahead and launch the DMS Replication instance.
* It gets created and finally attains “Available” status which indicates that the Replication instance is successfully launched.

4. Endpoint configurations:
* Now its time to create an endpoint that points to your MySQL source database.
* Give it a name.
* Choose Source Engine = MySQL
* And provide access to the database manually.
* Servername ==> This is the private IP address of the instance where your MySQL server is running.  Remember the EC2 instance you launched in previous exercise that was running MySQL server in a docker container?  That is the IP address that goes here.
* Port is 3306
* User: Root
* Password: Redis00$

5. Testing connectivity:
* Its time to test your connectivity between your Replication Instance and your MySQL Database instance.
* Click on your MySQL Source endpoint
* Click on Connections tab
* Click on Test Connection
* Choose the Replication Instance and hit “Run test” button
* Observe the “Testing” status.
* Once done the status becomes “Successful”

## Summary
Congratulations. You just finished creating an AWS DMS endpoint for your MySQL database and also tested the connectivity between a Replication instance and your MySQL database.

Great work. Take a quick break and start chasing the next exercise..
